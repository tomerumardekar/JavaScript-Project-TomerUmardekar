        <h1>Mardi Gras in New Orlins</h1>
        The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are
        concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start of
        lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many
        days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the
        Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities,
        including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).

        <h3>Mrdi Gras history</h3>
        The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th
        centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or fatted
        calf, followed France to her colonies.

        On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot of ground
        60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it was the eve
        of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702.
        In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.

        In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our current Mardi
        Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711 through
        1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade
        with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.

        New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New Orleans,
        but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
        established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.

        The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial governing body.
        That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and carnival
        organizations formed in New Orleans.

        By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to
        celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and lent
        each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe
        of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to
        New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.

        <h3> LaToya Cantrell </h3>

        LaToya Cantrell is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
        Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before becoming mayor,
        Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012â€“2018.
        Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
        history.[28]
        Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic plan
        to
        address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with
        finding
        solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city
        use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation,
        public
        parks, and green spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit
        against four opioid manufacturers and distributors.
